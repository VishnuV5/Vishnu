### hey there 👋

i'm vishnu — into robotics, CAD, and microcontrollers 🤖  
more on the mechanical & electronics side—designing in CAD, coding microcontrollers, and running simulations (shoutout to wokwi 👀)

jack of all trades, master of none... just figuring things out one project at a time.

- 📐 into CAD design (solidworks, fusion 360)
- 🐍 python dabbler
- 🔌 arduino & raspberry pi enthusiast
- 🌐 i use online simulators like wokwi instead of physical setups (for now)
- 🚗 know a bit of automobile engineering too—still learning!

### tools & things i mess with:
- 📐 CAD (solidworks, fusion 360)
- 🐍 python
- 🔌 arduino, raspberry pi, wokwi
- 🛠️ vscode, linux, git
- 🤯 random late-night ideas and lots of googling
